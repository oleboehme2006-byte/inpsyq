# Latent State vs. Behavioral Expression

## Overview
In the Structural Model Upgrade, InPsyq explicitly separates **Latent States** (internal psychological reality) from **Behavioral/Structural Expressions** (observable inputs and outputs).

## The Problem
Conflating "I feel unsafe" (State) with "I am not speaking up" (Behavior) leads to circular logic.
- **State**: The root cause.
- **Behavior**: The symptom.

## Classification

### 1. Structural (Inputs)
Tangible environmental factors.
- *Examples*: Role Clarity, Workload, Autonomy.
- **Actionable?**: YES. These are the levers.

### 2. Latent (States)
Internal psychological experiences. Cannot be "assigned".
- *Examples*: Psychological Safety, Trust, Meaning, Cognitive Dissonance.
- **Actionable?**: NO. You cannot "decree" safety. You must improve structure to emergent safety.

### 3. Behavioral (Outcomes)
Observable actions or aggregate states of being.
- *Examples*: Engagement.
- **Actionable?**: NO. This is the result.

## Rules
1. **Measurement**: Signals can come from both (Self-report state or Observed behavior).
2. **Inference**: Latent states are inferred from Structural inputs and Behavioral outputs.
3. **Actions**: The Action Engine MUST target `Structural` nodes to influence `Latent` nodes, which yield `Behavioral` outcomes.
