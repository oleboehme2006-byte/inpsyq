# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical phase-based documentation that was used during development.

These files are **archived for reference only** and should not be used for operational purposes. Use the consolidated documentation in the parent directories instead.

## Why Archived?

The original documentation was organized by development phases (PHASE22, PHASE23, etc.). This was useful during iterative development but becomes confusing for long-term maintenance.

The new structure organizes documentation by **function**:
- `docs/architecture/` — How the system works
- `docs/operations/` — How to operate the system
- `docs/security/` — Authentication, authorization, compliance
- `docs/development/` — Local development setup

## Can I Delete These?

Yes, these files can be safely deleted after verifying the consolidated documentation is complete. They are preserved here temporarily for reference during the transition.
