# Multi-Dimensional Risk Model

## Overview
InPsyq separates "risk" into three distinct vectors. High uncertainty (Epistemic) is not the same as High Burnout (Ethical).

## Dimensions

### 1. Epistemic Risk (The "Unknown")
- **Source**: High Sigma, Low N, Conflict.
- **Meaning**: "We don't know enough to speak."
- **Action**: **BLOCK** advice. Request more data.

### 2. Ethical Risk (The "Harm")
- **Source**: Severe deviations in `Psychological Safety`, `Fairness`, or `Emotional Load`.
- **Meaning**: "The situation is potentially unsafe for individuals."
- **Action**: **WARN**. Do not offer automated "fixes". Suggest human HR intervention.

### 3. Organizational Risk (The "Fallout")
- **Source**: Widespread anomalous signals (Turbulence).
- **Meaning**: "The organization is unstable."
- **Action**: Contextualize report as "Crisis Mode".

## Thresholds
- **Critical (Risk > 0.7)**: Blocking. No Action Engine output.
- **High (Risk > 0.5)**: Warning. Flags attached to all outputs.
